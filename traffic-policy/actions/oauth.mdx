The **OAuth** Traffic Policy action restricts access to only authorized users
by enforcing **OAuth** through an identity provider of your choice.

## Configuration Reference

The [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) configuration
reference for this action.

### Supported Phases

### Special Paths

#### `/ngrok/login`

Redirect users to this path to explicitly begin an authentication flow. After authentication, users will be redirected to `/`. If the IdP supports it, ngrok will attempt to instruct the IdP to force re-authentication which will force users to re-enter their credentials with the IdP even if they were already logged in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

#### `/ngrok/logout`

Logs the user out by clearing their session cookie. Redirect users to this path to log them out.

<Note>
When using the Google OAuth 2.0/OIDC provider in Chrome with a [managed profile](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/188446), `/ngrok/logout` only clears the ngrok session cookie; it does not end the Google/IdP session maintained by the browser. Users may be silently re-authenticated on the next request. To fully sign out, sign out of Chrome/Google (or use a non-managed profile or Incognito) in addition to calling `/ngrok/logout`.
</Note>

### Events

When this action is enabled, it populates the following fields in the
[http_request_complete.v0](/obs/events/reference/#http-request-complete) event:

- `oauth.app_client_id` 
- `oauth.decision`      
- `oauth.user.id`       
- `oauth.user.name`     

### Supported Providers

ngrok currently supports the following OAuth providers (see the Integration Guides for more details). In some instances, ngrok has a
[managed application](#managed-applications) that allows you to configure OAuth without setting up your own application in your provider. This is useful for testing and
development, but when you move into production, we recommend using your own custom application in your specific provider.

### Required Scopes

This is a list of the minimum required scopes for each provider. You can use this when configuring your identity provider. These are not
required when using the ngrok managed applications.

## Try it out

Consult the list of [supported providers](#supported-providers) for
step-by-step integration guides.

## Behavior

### Callback URL

When you create your own OAuth app, you must specify a 'Callback URL' or
'Redirect URL' to the OAuth provider. When using ngrok's OAuth action, that
Callback URL is always:

```
https://idp.ngrok.com/oauth2/callback
```

### Authentication

When an unauthenticated request is made to an OAuth-protected endpoint, it
returns a redirect response that begins an authentication flow with the
configured identity provider. The original URI path is saved so that users can
be redirected to it if they successfully authenticate.

**If the user fails to authenticate with the identity provider**, ngrok will
display an error describing the failure returned by the identity provider and
prompt them to try logging in again.

**If the user successfully authenticates with the identity provider**, ngrok
will take the following actions:

- Sets a [session cookie](#cookies) to avoid repeating the authentication flow again.
- Redirects the user to the original URI path they were attempting to access
  before the authentication flow began. If no such URI path was captured, they
  are redirected to `/`.
- Continue processing the rest of the traffic policy actions.

### Continuous Authorization

When an authenticated user makes a request, ngrok will sometimes refresh a
user's data from the identity provider (email, name, etc.) and re-evaluate
authorization constraints. This refresh is executed as a back channel request to
the identity provider; it is transparent to the user and they do not go through
a re-authentication flow.

The following circumstances trigger refresh and authorization re-evaluation:

- On a periodic interval defined by the [`userinfo_refresh_interval`](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/oauth/#configuration-fields) parameter.
- If you update the OAuth configuration of the endpoint either in the agent or through the dashboard.
- If you update the OAuth configuration of the endpoint.

If a previously authenticated user becomes unauthorized because their identity
provider information changed or because the OAuth action configuration changed,
they are presented an error and are prompted to try logging in again.

### Managed Applications

Managed applications allow you to use ngrok's OAuth action without setting up
your own OAuth apps with the identity providers. More practically, this means
you can use the OAuth action without configuring a client id and client secret.

Managed applications are great for getting started but they have some
limitations.

- They are [only available for some identity providers](#supported-providers).
- You may not pass custom scopes when using a managed application.
- The [upstream headers](/universal-gateway/http/#upstream-headers) `ngrok-auth-oauth-access-token` and
  `ngrok-auth-oauth-refresh-token` are not sent to your application.

### Traffic Identities

ngrok's [Traffic Identities](/docs/traffic-policy/identities/) feature can be used to observe
all of the authenticated user activity across your account in the ngrok
dashboard or via the API. Whenever a user authenticates or accesses an endpoint
with a configured OAuth action, their Traffic Identity record is created or updated.

You may also use Traffic Identities to remotely log a user out by [revoking a
session](/traffic-policy/identities/#revoke-sessions).

### Cookies

This action sets two cookies in its operation. Cookies values are opaque to the
upstream service and must not be modified.

| Cookie    | Description                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `session` | Used to track an authenticated user.    |
| `nonce`   | Used to secure the authentication flow. |
