# Agents Guide for ngrok-docs-v2

## Project Overview
This is the ngrok documentation site built on Mintlify. The navigation structure was converted from Docusaurus sidebar-example.js format to Mintlify docs.json format.

## Conversion Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Converted main navigation structure from sidebar-example.js to docs.json
- Preserved hierarchical organization with tabs and groups
- Applied "Overview" pattern for category links (categories that had `link` properties now have those pages as "Overview" child items)
- Organized major sections as tabs: Getting Started, Universal Gateway, Traffic Policy, Kubernetes, Traffic Observability, Secure Tunnels, Identity & Access, API, Errors, Guides, FAQ
- Root pages maintained at top level: overview/index, what-is-ngrok, how-ngrok-works, why-ngrok, whats-new
- Pricing & Limits kept as a group under main navigation

### üöß TODO Items (Autogenerated Content)
The following sections need manual population from their respective directories:

#### Traffic Policy
- `traffic-policy/getting-started/` - Currently only has `agent-endpoints/cli`, needs full directory scan
- `traffic-policy/concepts/` - Currently only has `index`, needs full directory scan  
- `traffic-policy/actions/` - Currently only has `index`, needs full directory scan
- `traffic-policy/variables/` - Currently only has `index`, needs full directory scan
- `traffic-policy/examples/` - Currently only has `index`, needs full directory scan

#### Universal Gateway
- `universal-gateway/examples/` - Currently only has main `examples` page, needs directory scan

#### Secure Tunnels
- `agent-sdks/` - Currently only has `index`, needs full directory scan

#### Guides
- `guides/device-gateway/` - Empty, needs directory scan
- `guides/identity-aware-proxy/` - Empty, needs directory scan  
- `using-ngrok-with/` - Empty, needs directory scan
- `integrations/` - Currently only has `index`, needs directory scan

### üîç How to Complete TODO Items

For each autogenerated directory above:

1. **Find the directory**: `ls -la [directory-name]/`
2. **List .mdx files**: `find [directory] -name "*.mdx" -type f | sort`
3. **Add to docs.json**: Update the respective `pages` array with the file paths (without .mdx extension)

Example for `traffic-policy/actions/`:
```bash
find traffic-policy/actions -name "*.mdx" -type f | sort
# Results might be:
# traffic-policy/actions/index.mdx
# traffic-policy/actions/compress-response.mdx
# traffic-policy/actions/deny.mdx
# traffic-policy/actions/log.mdx
```

Then update docs.json:
```json
{
  "group": "Actions",
  "pages": [
    "traffic-policy/actions/index",
    "traffic-policy/actions/compress-response", 
    "traffic-policy/actions/deny",
    "traffic-policy/actions/log"
  ]
}
```

## Navigation Structure Decisions Made

### HTML Section Dividers
Original Docusaurus had `{type: "html", value: "<div class='menu__section'>Platform</div>"}` - these were converted to logical tab groupings rather than visual separators.

### Category Links ‚Üí Overview Pattern  
Categories that had `link: { type: "doc", id: "..." }` were converted to have that linked page as the first child called "Overview", unless a child with that same link already existed.

### Getting Started as Tab
Per user request, "Getting Started" was converted from a category to a full tab with nested groups (Agent CLI, Cloud Endpoints, SDKs, Kubernetes).

### Nested Structure Preservation
Complex nested categories like Universal Gateway > Endpoints > Types > Cloud Endpoints were preserved with the same depth and hierarchy.

## Development Commands
*(To be added based on package.json investigation)*

## Notes
- Original file: `sidebar-example.js` (761 lines)
- Comments removed from JSON (JSON doesn't support comments)
- Mintlify navigation supports: tabs, groups, pages, and nested structures
- Empty page arrays left for autogenerated sections to be filled later
