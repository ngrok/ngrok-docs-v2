title: Endpoint Types

Endpoints have a **type**, which can be either `agent` or `cloud`.

## Cloud Endpoints vs Agent Endpoints

In general, Cloud Endpoints are the most flexible option, but which endpoint type you should choose depends on your use-case. The following table outlines the differences between Cloud and Agent endpoints.

|                                                           | **[Cloud Endpoints](/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/)**                                             | **[Agent Endpoints](/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/)**                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lifetime**                                              | Always-on. Must be manually terminated.                                                                | Live as long as the [agent](/agent) process that started them.                                     |
| **Connection Handling**                                   | Can be configured with [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/).                                             | Forward traffic to the agent that created them.                                                    |
| **Configuration**                                         | Can be managed at any time via the [API](/api/) or [dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints). | Managed by the agent that initiates them.                                                          |
| **Dashboard accessibility**                               | Can be created and configured from the dashboard.                                                      | Read-only in the dashboard.                                                                        |
| **Can use generated URLs?**                               | **No**. Must be provided a fully qualified URL on creation.                                            | **Yes**. Ngrok can generate a URL for you on creation.                                             |
| **Traffic Policy required?**                              | **Yes**.                                                                                               | **No**, but you can provide one if you'd like.                                                     |
| **Globally available**                                    | **Yes**.                                                                                               | **No**.                                                                                            |
| **Can be managed with [the API](/api/)?**                 | **Yes**.                                                                                               | Yes, but [the `/endpoints` resource](/api/resources/endpoints/) can only read agent endpoint data. |
| **[Pricing options](https://ngrok.com/pricing?ref=docs)** | Available on paid plans.                                                                               | Available on all plans.                                                                            |

### Cloud Endpoint use cases

Cloud endpoints are a good choice when you want to:

- **Centrally manage an endpoint's traffic policy configuration**
  - Decouple traffic management for your public services from traffic management for your internal services, which can each have their own local traffic policies.
- **Create always-on endpoints that aren't tied to the lifetime of an agent process**
  - Your endpoints will stay live even if the service they're connected to goes offline.
- **Route incoming traffic to multiple other endpoints based on path, IP, header, and more**
  - Painlessly send multicloud traffic to the correct cloud every time.
- **Create a loose coupling between the traffic-receiving endpoint and the traffic-servicing endpoint**
  - You can accept requests to your Cloud Endpoint even when the internal endpoint it routes traffic to is down.
- **Update an endpoint's traffic policy without taking it offline**
  - Enable conditional access to resources by updating your Cloud Endpoint's traffic policy to point to different internal endpoints based on the request.

:::tip
It's a common pattern to create public cloud endpoints that route traffic to internal agent endpoints via the [forward
action](/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/). The traffic policy of a Cloud Endpoint must terminate traffic via actions such as `deny`, `redirect`, `custom-response`, or `forward-internal`.

### Agent Endpoint use cases

Agent endpoints are a good choice when you want to:

- **Put applications running anywhere online**.
  - Your app could be running in a anywhere, e.g. AWS, Digital Ocean, in a container or a VM, on your laptop, in your home lab, etc.
- **Create connectivity to apps running in ephemeral environments like CI**.
- **Ensure that an endpoint goes offline when your process or machine is disconnected**.
- **You can use agent endpoints to create connectivity to apps running on your localhost, an IoT device in the field, or an EC2 instance**.
  - Because agent endpoints are created via [Secure Tunnel agents](/agent/), they are excellent for connecting to apps running on all networks, even those behind a NAT.

### Protocols, Binding and Pooling

Both Agent and Cloud Endpoints support:

- All [Endpoint Protocols](/universal-gateway/protocols/)
  - `http/https`
  - `tcp`
  - `tls`
- All [Endpoint Bindings](/universal-gateway/bindings/)
  - `public`
  - `internal`
  - `kubernetes`
- Endpoint Pooling. You can also pool Agent Endpoints with Cloud Endpoints.
